Before start let's discuss a little bit about why I decided to write this specific article and share my experience. Many times during my professional path I had a situation where I need quickly to verify, understand or implement a concept, piece of code, simple function, class method, compare results between two solutions, etc. And every time it was a pain. For example each programming language you need a special environment, IDE, and many other things. But I don't want spend my time to deal with all these things. I need one solution for everything, and it should be fast, robust, and useful. This is the reason why I came up with an idea to use [Jupiter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) then [Jupiter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install.html) as a platform for my virtual laboratory.
