Howdy partner! <br>
Today I would like to share some tips about how to learn, use, and improve programming skills.

This article based on author experince. 

Before start let's discuss a little bit about why I decided to write this specific article and share my experience. Many times during my professional path I had a situation where I need quickly to verify, understand or implement a concept, piece of code, simple function, class method, compare results between two solutions, etc. And every time it was a pain. For example each programming language you need a special environment, IDE, and many other things. But I don't want spend my time to deal with all these things. I need one solution for everything, and it should be fast, robust, and useful. This is the reason why I came up with an idea to use [Jupiter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) then [Jupiter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install.html) as a platform for my virtual laboratory.

Jupiter Lab can execute code (e.g. Python, Java, etc.) in a browser and returns results to the user immediately. It's possible because Jupiter supports [kernels for many programming languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).

Let's see what we may get after installation and configuration Jupyter Lab, kernels for Python, Java, JavaScript, and Julia programming languages.
We may easily open a new notebook or a terminal, start to write code, and immidiatly get result.

Start Jupyter Lab:
todo ->

Execute simple code for Python:
todo ->

Execute simple code for JavaScript:
todo ->

Open terminal and run Java:
todo ->

This approach is easy and fast (per my humble opinion). Do you agree with me? 
Yes, I understand you need to spend some time installing and configure everything but in the end, you will get your own virtual laboratory for experiments and what is more exited thing is you may easily share your experiments with other peoples.

I hope this knowledge opens a new horizon for you. <br>

Thanks for reading and don't stop learning and trying new things! <br>
