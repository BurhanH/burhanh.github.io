Recently I finished "Python: Data analysis" course on LinkedIn Learning.
I started thinking of how to apply this knowledge to my practical experience. 

And then - Bingo!
At the same time, I was watching a wonderful serial "Game Of Thrones" and the idea was clear, 
what if I'll take data from SSA.gov with baby names and try to compare (do some analysis) the show popularity and baby names.

Finally, I spent a few hours at night and got the result [baby-names-analysis](https://github.com/BurhanH/data-analysis/blob/master/baby-names-analysis/Baby%20names%20analysis.ipynb). (Spoiler: Aria winner!)

Note! It was an experiment, I know it's silly but the main goal was to apply knowledge to a real example.

Next few months I will try to create more scientific and "adult" research to improve and prove my knowledge in Data Science field.
