        "Kokoro: First, fusion energy’s heating up. On March 23, FusionCore’s tokamak hit break-even—energy out equals energy in—for 30 seconds. Using a high-density plasma and upgraded magnetic coils, it produced 500 megawatts. It’s a step toward limitless clean power, but scaling it? That’s a decade off, with heat management still tricky. Speaking of breakthroughs, data’s going biological next. On March 24, BioStore launched the first commercial DNA storage system, cramming 1 petabyte—think a million gigabytes—into a sugar-cube-sized vial. It encodes bits into synthetic DNA strands, stable for centuries. Archiving’s the win here; retrieval’s slow at 10 MBps. Then, holograms are stepping up. On March 25, HoloTech debuted a 4K volumetric display—no glasses needed. It uses laser arrays and a spinning graphene sheet to project 3D images in midair, hitting 60 frames per second. VR and remote surgery could thrive, but costs are sky-high for now. Shifting gears, biology meets AI in our fourth story. On March 26, DeepFold’s new model cracked protein folding predictions in under 10 seconds per structure—50 times faster than AlphaFold. Trained on a quantum-accelerated dataset, it’s 95% accurate. Drug design’s the prize, though rare proteins still stump it. Up next, robots are moon-bound. On March 27, LunarWorks unveiled a swarm of 100 microbots that 3D-print habitats from regolith. In tests, they built a 10-meter dome in 48 hours, synced via edge AI. It’s a blueprint for lunar bases, but solar storms could fry their circuits. Lastly, climate tech’s scaling fast. On March 28, ClimaTech unveiled a direct air capture rig designed to pull 1 gigaton of CO2 per year—enough to offset a small country. It uses a new nanomaterial filter, cutting energy use by 30%. It’s a carbon game-changer, but deployment costs billions. That’s your six horizons—fusion power, DNA vaults, hologram leaps, protein breakthroughs, lunar swarms, and carbon wins. 2025’s tech train isn’t slowing! This is Kokoro—stay tuned for what’s next!",
